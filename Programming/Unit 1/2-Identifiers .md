# Identifiers name convention 

Having good names for our identifiers allow us to easily read the code.

The names have to be clear ,short and intuitive. It means that the identifier have to show an idea of it´s self.



### Main benefits 

- Give metadata(additional information) about the identifier.
- Developer team coherency.
- Clearly.
- Looks better and professional.
- Avoid name collision .



## Identifiers with multiple words 

Sometimes identifiers must be more specific and is for this reason that names need more than one word, but most of the programming languages do not allow empty spaces on identifiers, so the main solution is use a notation.



### Notations

- Camel 

  It use capitalization to differentiate 2 different words.  

  There are variants of this notation

  - UpperCamelCase, CamelCase or PascalCase

    ```javascript
    var MyMainVariable;
    ```

  - lowerCamelCase, camelCase or dromedaryCase

    ```javascript
    var miMainVariable;
    ```

- C notation

  It use '_' symbol to differentiate 2 different words.

  ```javascript
  var MI_MAIN_VARIABLE;
  ```

- Hungarian notation

  Based on camel notation but adding a letter sequence that allow us to know the variable type.

  ```javascript
  var lblTitle;
  var strName;
  ```
