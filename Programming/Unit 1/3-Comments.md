# Code comments

There is no excuse to forget comment the code, but there are limits for this.

Comment classes must be simple, just for describe relation with other classes, and describe some important methods.

Method comments describe what it does, but never how it works. If we include information about the arguments and the return value always will be helpful.

Variable comments are used when the name of the identifier is not clearly enough and it must be more descriptive but short.

Never ever use unnecessary comments!.
