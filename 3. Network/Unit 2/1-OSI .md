# OSI Model

Open System Interconnection was created by the international organization of standardization (ISO) to communicate different devices with standards and  protocols.

- It is the primary architectural model for networks
- It describes how data and network information are communicated
- It is divided in 7 approach layers
- It is not a physical model, it´s a conceptual model.

- It provides frameworks for creating and implementing network standars.

This model is hierarchical and its purpose is allow different vendors´ networks to interoperate smoothly.



**Advantages**

- It divides network communication into smaller components.

- It allows multiple-vendor development through the standardization of network components.

- It encourages industry standardization.

- It allow various types of network hardware and software communicate.

- It prevents changes in one layer from affecting other layers.

  

## The layered approach

A reference model is a conceptual blueprint of how communications should take place.

It addresses  all the processes required for effective communication and divides these processes into logical groupings called layers.

**Layer architecture** 

Is a communication system designed in layers.

**Binding**

It means that we don´t need to be concerned with others any layer and we must be focus in a particular layer.
