# Introduction

### What is a network?

It is a group or system interconnected people or thinks.

They are communicating using binary code.



# LAN

Local Area Network is usually restricted to spanning a particular geographic location such as an office building or even a home office.

Usually a LAN become into smaller logical zones known as workgroup to make administration easier.

## Workgroup

Workgroup in LAN is  a set of devices with no security association  with one another. it mean that they physically are in the same network segment.

A large workgroup run  slow because there is a legion of hosts within them  that are all trying to get the same resources simultaneously.

But... what if we want to connect 2 LAN together?

The solution is connect those LANs networks to a router.

We could  connect two LANs together by just using a cable but it means these problems:

- Doesn't has two separate workgroups
- It isn't  practical because  it doesn't has fast responses times.

## Common network components

- Workstation

  Are powerful computers that run more than one CPU and whose resources are avialable to other users on the network to access when needed.

- Server

  Are powerful computers, they provide services to the network and run specialized software as the network operating system to maintain and control the network.

  Servers can run multiple tasks at the same time but it is not recommended because you will get better performance if you dedicate a server to a single task.

  Delicate servers types:

  - **File server**

    Store and dispenses files.

  - **Mail Server**

    Handles email functions.

  - **Print Server**

    Manage printers

  - **Web Server Fax Server**

    Manage webs activities by running HTTP protocol for storing web content and accessing web pages.

  -  **Application Server**

    Manage network applications.

  - **Telephony Server**

    Handles the call center and call routing.

  - **Proxy Server**

    Handles tasks in the place of other machines on the network, particularly a INternet connection.

- Hosts

  It means any network device with an IP.
