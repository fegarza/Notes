# Network architectures

There are two main network types: peer-to-peer and client-server.



## Peer-to-peer

Doesn't have a central authority unit to connect computers together.

The computers are all equals.

The computers  on the network can be client and can be server machines.

This works pretty well as long as there isn't a huge number of users on the network and if the network doesn't require much security.

## Client server

A server uses a network operating system for managing the whole network.
